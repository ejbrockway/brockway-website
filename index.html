                <h3>Rogue Pickings:</h3> <p>This project is meant to inforce everything that you have learned in Jubilee Austen. It is also a secondary project specifically designed to challenge the student. This webstie is also used when learning about git and github.

                <h3>Reciept Card Site:</h3> <p>This project was to help develope our CSS skills. You work with multiple floats and design features that help explore CSS in great detail. It also encourages students to go outside thier confort zones and use some more difficult CSS concepts. The project is challenging and rewarding for those students who complete it.

        <div class= "half-width">
          <p> I am a book loving, crochet hat making, nature lover who also happens to enjoy coding. I have developed an eclectic background in my quest to find my passion. This means that I have done a little bit of everything. It also means that I have adaptability and compassion in the work I do.
            My goal is to enter the tech industry and help people achieve their programming needs.  Iâ€™ve found that I really enjoy the process of coding and know that I will succeed in this new chapter.
